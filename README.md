# Spark Space Sample Project - Frontend

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to give you a real sense of the type of work you’d be doing and will give us a sense of your coding ability.

### Requirements

Limit yourself to 2 hours, do as much as you can. It's ok if you don't finish everything. As a early stage startup we often value velocity more than perfection.

### Steps

1. Fork this repo
2. You will see 4 cards on the front page with the following content:
   - AI Feedback
   - AI Detection
   - Import Essays
   - Use Your Rubric
3. For the first 2 cards, make the following animations:
   - AI Feedback: Make the text on the right appear with a ChatGPT-like typewriter animation
   - AI Detection: Make the gauge grow from 0% to 37%
4. For the last 2 cards, design and implement a compelling animation for each of the value props, in order to increase the click rate of the CTA button.
5. Record a loom video explaining your implementation and design. Send it to david@sparkspace.ai
6. Please send us a link to your code too:)
   
Thank you for your time! 🙏
